Data types, variables and arrays
	Type checking.
	Premitive types
		byte, int, short, char, long, float, double, boolean
		** Write a program to print the size and range of all the premitive datatypes.
		Type promotion and using smaller data types like short and byte when big values are not needed.
		** write a program to calculate the distance travelled by light in 5 days and 5 hour. What data type you would use.
		speed of light = 30000 m/s
		** write a program to test the precision/decimal digits limit of float and double data types.
		** Write a program to find the area of circle with radius 235.767778322. Use float and double both.

// OUTPUT
class App {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception 
    {
        char c = (char)65;
        System.out.print(c);
	}
}

		** Write a program to print all the lower case alphabets.
		What are litrals ?
		** Write a program to assign binary, octal and hexadecimal value to an int. Print the values.
		** Add boolean, char, string, integer literal values.

What will happen ?
int i = 09;
int i = 99_22_33;
double d = 2_3_4.5_6_7;

Escape sequences.
Constant vs dynamic initialization. Nested scopes
int i = 0;
int j = Math.sqrt(81);

		** Write a program to test the scope and lifetime of a local and instance variable.
		
What is casting. What is narrowing convertion ? What is data truncation ?
What is type promotion ? What are type promotion rules ?
		** Write a program to Type cast a char to int, int to char, double to int, int to double, float to double and double to float.
		What did you analyzed ?
		** write a program to create an integer array of 12 indexes. Assign values to number of days in month to the indexes. And print the indexes
		** Try to access index 13 and check what happens. Can you catch the exception and recover from that exception ?
		
		** Write a program to create a two dimentional array of size 5x5. Assign random values to all the indexes and print the indexes.

How address work for objects.
        int [] i = {1,2,3};
        int [] j = {1,2,3};
        System.out.println(i);
        System.out.println(j);
        j = i;
        System.out.println(j);


Operators:		
What operators are supported by Java ?

		** Write a program having a function which accepts a number and prints true if the number is divisible by 2 other prints false.
		
Which is faster ? ++x or x++.
What are bitwise operators ?
		
		** Write a program which do a bitwise OR operation of 5 and 7 and the prints the values of the operation.
		** Write a program which do a bitwise AND operation of 5 and 7 and then pritns the values after the operation.

What is XOR operator ?
		** Write a program to do a bitwise XOR operation of 5 and  7 and then prints the values after the operation.
		
		Bitwise problems: ######
		** Write a program to print the most significant byte of a number.
		** Write a program to get the nth bit of a number.
		** Write a program to set nth bit of a number.
		** Write a program to invert the nth bit of a number.
		** Write a program to clear the nth bit of a number.
		** Write a program to print the number in binary.
		** Write a program to print a hexadecimal number in decimal form.
		** Write a program to print total numbers of 1's and 0's in a number.
		** Write a program to invert all the bits of a number.
		
What is "?" operator ?
eg. test = test ? test : 0;
